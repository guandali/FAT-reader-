Total before late penalty: [26/30]


Notes:

    1. Features  that are  only partially implemented  should be  graded, and
       part marks awarded when applicable.

    2. A correct implementation of parts 1  and 2, with no work done for part
       3, will be worth 23/30. Students who also implemented part 3 correctly
       may end up with 34/30.


  Part 1: reading and interpreting the boot sector  [6/6]
  ------------------------------------------------

    The code should successfully read the first 512 bytes of the file [2/2]



    The code should extract the appropriate bytes [1/1]



    Integers written using more than 1 byte should be decoded correctly [2/2]



    All of the requested information is printed out correctly [1/1]




  Part 2: extracting information from the root directory [7/8]
  ------------------------------------------------------


    The program prints information about all files in the root directory. [3/3]



    The program stops at the last valid entry. [2/2]



    All of the information requested in part 2 is printed. [2/2]



    Deleted files are not listed. [0/1]




  Part 3: extracting information from all directories [6/11]
  ---------------------------------------------------

    Subdirectories of the root directory are visited [1/1]



    The traversal is recursive so deeply nested files are also visited [1/3]
        - Either   full  path  names   must  be   printed,  or   names  in
          subdirectories must be located  below the names for their parent
          and indented appropriately. [-0.5 if not done]

    Full paths are not printed. Entries for . and .. have no names.
    Extra entries printed with erroneous information.


    The lists of clusters for each file are printed out [1/4]
        - Printing all of them as in 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
          is fine.

        - It is also fine to print a list in the format 3, 6-9, 12-17


    1 mark for starting cluster


    All files in a directory using multiple clusters are visited [3/3]




  Coding style and documentation [4/4]
  ------------------------------

        - the code is broken down into functions that have a well-defined
          purpose. [2/2]



        - each function is preceded by a comment explaining what it does. [1/1]



        - variable names are meaningful [1/1]



  The code is reasonably efficient [2/2]
  --------------------------------

        - for instance,  the boot sector  and FAT  are read into  buffers and
          information extracted from these buffers,  instead of doing a large
          number of read() operations on 1 or 2 bytes each.



  Time taken for the assignment [1/1]
